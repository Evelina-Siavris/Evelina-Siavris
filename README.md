### Hi there, I'm Evelina ✌️

### I'm a junior data analyst based in Vilnius, Lithuania. 

### I decided to change my career path to data analytics, because of my vast interest in data and the entire process of analyzing. It all comes from my passion to solve problems - specifically using insightful research. Puzzles have always been a favorite of mine! 🚀

### Having successfully graduated from the Vilnius Coding School Data Analytics course, studying a lot on my own and finishing multiple DataCamp courses - I am very eager to learn everything I can to grow and excel my career. ⭐

### I invite you to look at projects I've worked on and feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, email or my website www.datawitheva.com ✉️ 

### Fun fact: I have three cats 😸
